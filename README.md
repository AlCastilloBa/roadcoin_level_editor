# Technical details

Uses python 3 and Tkinter for building the user interface. The graphical viewer window is created using a Tkinter canvas. The aim is to get a simple and minimal, but functional interface.

Tested on Python 3.7.7, under GNU/Linux. Other versions or operating systems not tested yet.

# Current status

Currently on the final stages of development. The application can load and show maps, the panning and zooming is operational. Items can be selected and modified directly on the editor window. New items can be added, by pointing and clicking directly on the viewer window. Additionally, tables can be used for editing. Properties can be modified, and levels can be saved.

The required funcitonality for editing is implemented. The application is currently being used to create new levels. Intense debugging is expected at this stage.
