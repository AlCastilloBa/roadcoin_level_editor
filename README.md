# Technical details

Uses python 3 and Tkinter for building the user interface. The graphical viewer window is created using a Tkinter canvas. The aim is to get a simple and minimal, but functional interface.

# Current status

Currently under development. The application can load and show maps, the panning and zooming is operational. Items can be selected and modified. 
New items can be added, by pointing and clicking directly on the viewer window.

Possibility to save maps is coming soon.
